This is a place-holder stylesheet, to keep WP Theme Check 
{@see http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/} happy. The "real"
stylesheet is in library/css/style.css. This theme uses the SASS 
css preprocessor to generate the css files used by the site. Both 
the sass and css files are in library/scss and library/css.

/*
WordPress Probz
So Theme Check (http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/)
is constantly telling me that it needs these classes in the CSS even
though they are in the REAL stylesheet in library/css/style.css.
So we're gonna drop these here to keep it happy.
Great work, Theme Check (eye roll)
