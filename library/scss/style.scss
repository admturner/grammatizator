Here's where the magic happens. First we import partials -- everything
in these should be universal from mobile on up. Everything else gets 
called after that in separate media queries. The base mobile goes
outside any query and is called at the beginning, after that we call 
the rest of the styles inside media queries.

@todo Move unneeded _base styles to one of the next two steps to save on mobile data/downloads

/*********************
IMPORTING PARTIALS
These files are needed at the beginning so that we establish all
our mixins, functions, and variables that we'll be using across
the whole project.
*********************/

// normalize: http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/
@import "partials/normalize";

// Sass variables
@import "partials/variables";

// typography
@import "partials/typography";

// Sass functions
@import "partials/functions";

// import mixins
@import "partials/mixins";

/*********************
IMPORTING MODULES
Modules are reusable blocks or elements we use throughout the project.
We can break them up as much as we want or just keep them all in one.
I mean, you can do whatever you want. The world is your oyster. Unless
you hate oysters, then the world is your peanut butter & jelly sandwich.
*********************/

// alert boxes
@import "modules/alerts";

// buttons
@import "modules/buttons";

// forms (inputs & labels)
@import "modules/forms";

/*********************
BASE (MOBILE) SIZE
This are the mobile styles. It's what people see on their phones. If
you set a great foundation, you won't need to add too many styles in
the other stylesheets. Remember, keep it light: Speed is Important.
*********************/

/* styles in base.scss */
@import "breakpoints/base";

/*********************
SMALLISH SCREENS
This is for screen widths that pass the first step in our
modular grid where things start to feel a little streched
and small.
*********************/
@media only screen and (min-width: 31.952em) {

	/* ~511.227px and up: styles in _31.952up.scss */
	@import "breakpoints/31.952up";

} /* end of 31.952em media query */

/*********************
MEDIUM SCREENS
This is for screen widths that hit the width of our main content
section at its maximum size (maximum for the site, just for the 
article content).
*********************/
@media only screen and (min-width: 45em) {

	/* ~722px and up: styles in _45up.scss */
	@import "breakpoints/45up";

} /* end of 45em media query */

/*********************
DESKTOP
This is the average viewing window. So Desktops, Laptops, and
in general anyone not viewing on a mobile device. Here's where
you can add resource intensive styles.
*********************/
@media only screen and (min-width: 64.375em) {

	/* ~1030px and up: styles in _64.375em.scss */
	@import "breakpoints/64.375up";

} /* end of 64.375em media query */

/*********************
RETINA (2x RESOLUTION DEVICES)
This applies to the retina iPhone (4s) and iPad (2,3) along with
other displays with a 2x resolution. You can also create a media
query for retina AND a certain size if you want. Go Nuts.
*********************/

/* Causing odd validator issues. Since there's nothing there for now, just don't load it yet.

@media only screen and (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),
       only screen and (min--moz-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5),
       only screen and (min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5) {

	// styles in 2x.scss
	@import "breakpoints/2x";

} // end of media query */

/*********************
PRINT STYLESHEET
Feel free to customize this. Remember to add things that won't make
sense to print at the bottom. Things like nav, ads, and forms should
be set to display none.
*********************/
@media print {

	// styles in print.scss
	@import "partials/print";

}
