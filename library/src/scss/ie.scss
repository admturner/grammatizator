Stylesheet: IE Stylesheet

So instead of using the respond.js file to add media query support
to IE, we're going to use SASS to create an easily readable css file.
Here, we import all the styles the standard stylesheet gets, only
without the media queries. No need to worry about editing anything!

/******************************************************************
IMPORTS & DEPENDENCIES
Remember, all the BASE styles are called already since IE can
read those. Below, we need to import only the stuff IE can't
understand (what's inside the media queries). We also need to
import the mixins file so SASS can understand the variables.
******************************************************************/

@import "partials/variables"; // import variables
@import "partials/typography"; // import typography
@import "partials/mixins"; // import mixins

// import everything inside media queries
@import "breakpoints/31.952up";
@import "breakpoints/45up";
@import "breakpoints/64.375up";
